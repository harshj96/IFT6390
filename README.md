# Machine Learning in Credit Card Industry
The Processing the uncertainty of frauds and defaults in credit card industry is 
now highly needful considering the increasing scale of credit card crimes in t-
he modern society. In this paper, we aim to modern machine learning techniques
techniques to create model that can accurately classify default or fraudulent cases 
from new example data. We explore the impact of imbalanced data on our chosen 
classifiers-Bayes, Random Forrest and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with sigm- 
oidal output. We also explore the alternative performance measure to optimally h-
andle the highly imbalanced data.
